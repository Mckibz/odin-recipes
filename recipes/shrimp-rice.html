            <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 pound medium peeled, deveined raw shrimp</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium. Add onion, and 
                cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and translucent, about 3 minutes. Add 
                garlic, and cook, stirring constantly, until garlic is fragrant and onions are lightly 
                browned, about 1 minute. Stir in wine, and cook, stirring occasionally, until wine 
                is reduced by half, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in chicken stock, lemon zest, salt, and black pepper. Bring to a boil over 
                medium, and stir in rice. Cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer, undisturbed, 
                until rice is just cooked through, 9 to 10 minutes. Add shrimp to the rice in an even 
                layer; drizzle with lemon juice, and dot with remaining 4 tablespoons butter. 
                Cover and continue to cook over medium until shrimp and rice are cooked 
                through, 5 to 6 minutes. </li>
            <li>Remove from heat. Stir in Parmesan cheese and basil. Garnish with lemon 
                wedges and basil leaves.</li>
        </ol>
