                <li>1/2 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>3 green onions, sliced, or as need for garnish</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place bacon in a large cast iron skillet and cook over medium0high heat, turning 
                    occasionally, until slightly crisp, about 7 minutes. Remove bacon slices to a 
                    paper towel-lined plate. When bacon is cool enough to handle, crumble roughly 
                    and set aside.</li>
                <li>Add onion to the same skillet with bacon grease and saute until softened, about 
                    3 minutes. Add garlic, salt, and pepper. Stir until garlic is fragrant, about 30 
                seconds.</li>
                <li>Add ground beef. Cook and stif until beef is crumbly and no longer pink, about 5 
                    minutes. Lower heat to medium-low, and stif in beef broth, Worcestershire 
                    sauce, and hot sauce. Stir in 1/2 of the crumbled bacon.</li>
                <li>Break spaghetti noodles in half. Scatter over ground beef, making sure noodles 
                    are separated. Pour tomatoes with green chiles, fire-roasted tomatoes, and 
                    tomato sauce over noodles. Cover and cook for 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the lid and stir to cmobine the pasta and sauce. Smooth out mixture 
                    and scatter shredded cheese evenly over top. Sprinkle with remaining bacon. 
                    Cover and let cheese melt, about 5 minutes. Garnish with green onions; serve 
                    immediately.</li>
            </ol>
